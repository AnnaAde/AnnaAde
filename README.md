## About

Hello, I’m Anna Ade (Ah-day). I am a songwriter, artist, and marketing professional.

I like to bake and cook, go on walks in the city or suburbs, and spontaneously drive 45+ minutes for warm cookies, donuts, and/or ramen noodles (and that's on growing up in a city an hour away from everthing except Target and Costco - NYC being an hour away is nice though).

### Aspirations

I tell my friends that I have "15 businesses" that I would like to run. I am half joking and fully serious when I say this. The other half of the joke is how I expect to effectively manage them all (haven't thought about it yet).

Here are five of them. I'm waiting for the rest to come to me:

1. App for shopping smarter. (That's all I'm saying for now, I'm not Ben Awading with details).
2. Fashion line - starting with pockets that are pockets (not fakes) - because *function* can be and is fashionable.
3. Organizational fixtures for desks, bedrooms, kitchens because I like my messes to be *organized* messes. Disclaimer: I'm mostly clean and neat with my spaces.
4. Platform for songwriters to share songs/demos with artists (obviously with intellectual property protections in mind).
5. AirBnb/Rental House. I want a second home for vacations, but you're funny if you think I'm letting a house sit for most of the year empty.

### Interests

Music production, web development, and visual art.

I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and D3.js
