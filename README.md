## About

Hello, I’m Anna Ade (Ah-day). I am a songwriter, artist, and marketing professional.

I like to bake and cook, go on walks in the city or suburbs, and spontaneously drive 45+ minutes for warm cookies, donuts, and/or ramen noodles.

### Aspirations

I tell my friends that I have "15 businesses" that I would like to run. I am half joking and fully serious when I say this. The other half of the joke is how I expect to effectively manage them all (haven't thought about it yet).

### Interests

Music production, web development, and visual art.

I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and D3.js
